// Greetings:Start with the array you used in exercise 11,but instead of just printing each person's name,print a message to them.The text of each message should be the same,but each message should be personalized with the person name.

let friendName: string[] = ["ahad","bilal","samad","ali"];

console.log(`Hello ${friendName[0]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${friendName[1]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${friendName[2]}, how are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${friendName[3]}, how are you?`);
